# HALE-simulations
Repository for simulation files for the High Altitude Liquid Engine Team for easy collaboration and version control. 

The Oregon State University High Altitude Liquid Engine team is a student-led competition rocketry team, advised by Dr. Kyle Niemeyer, that is a part of the Oregon State University AIAA branch. The overarching goal of the HALE team project is to build a single-stage liquid engine rocket that will reach the Karman Line, which is the generally accepted barrier to space.

The team was founded in 2018 and is a current competitor in the Base 11 Space Challenge, which is a national collegiate competition with a grand prize of one million dollars for the first team to successfully launch a single-stage liquid engine to space.

In addition to this competition, the HALE team is the first liquid engine development project at OSU and our success is therefore foundational to furthering aerospace research at the university. As the first liquid engine project at OSU, thorough analysis is needed to understand the fluid flow and combustion processes of the engine to maximize performance. This repository is to be used for version control and collaboration on STAR CCM+ simulations.
